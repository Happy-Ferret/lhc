* Sharing analysis in HPT.
* Validation of bedrock AST.
* Check weather we optimize away all the stack frames for functions
  that do not use global registers, exceptions or the GC, nor call
  any function that does.
* Related to above. Find the functions that do not need to be CPS
  transformed. It's better to not do the transformation than to
  rely on optimizations to remove the stack frames.
